    "#### Original Problem Spec\n",
    "\n",
    "**The hypothesis of interest**: a pupil receiving free school meals, an indicator of 'disadvantage', is just as likely as a pupil not receiving free school meals to achieve the KS4 benchmark, regardless of the intake profile of their school.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The desired outcome**a probability of a pupil attaining the required level of progress based on their KS2 attainment upon entry to the school in question. One of the key factors for pupil attainment appears to be whether they are advantaged/disadvantaged as well as the attainment achieved at KS2.  This is a categorical problem, which at first glance suggested a logistic regression approach.\n",
